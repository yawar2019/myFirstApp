Guard Service?

if you want to provide based on crediantial redirectin
to routes you can take Guard Service

To implement Guard Service three services you can take

1)CAnActivate   used for Current Route
2)CAnActivateChild  used for child Route
3)CAnDeactivate  when we leave on Route to another Route




To Implement Authentication based on User Crediantial first create AppService


AppService will two Methods

SetAuth method
getAuth  method


SetAuth Method will take as a parameter value to set your localStorage With Value


setAuthDetails(value:string)
  {
    localStorage.setItem('ValidCred',value);
  }


getAuth Method will return value from localStorage

  getAuthDetails()
  {
    return localStorage.getItem('ValidCred')?.toString();
  }





Create Login PAge



Two Methods

Login and Logout


Login witll Set Auth Details value using setAuthDetails method


setAuthDetails will set two type of value true or false

for Login True

login()
{
this.apps.setAuthDetails('true')
}


for Logout False 
logOut()
{

this.apps.setAuthDetails('false')
}


when you navigating from one page to another page by clicking navigation button

and we want user to not to access resource then implement Guard Service

In Guard Service name is AppGuard Service


here we are going to implement canActivate method




CanActivate return either true or false


In Our App.route ts,

 {path:'about/:id/:name',component:About,canActivate:[AppGuardService]},


CanActivate Child restrict for childRoute




 {path:"contact",
    component:Contact,
    children:[{path:':id/:name',component:User,canActivateChild:[AppGuardService]}]
    },


canActivateChild it is boolean value true or false we we need to return


if it is true child route will be accessable else not

 {path:"contact",
    component:Contact,
    children:[{path:':id/:name',component:User,canActivateChild:[AppGuardService]},
        
    ]
