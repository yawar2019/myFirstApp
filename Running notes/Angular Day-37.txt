Deferable Views also known as @defer Block
Main is to Bring Template Level Lazy Loading for Components,Directives and pipes


Deferrable views reduce initial Bundle size by loading content when needed instead during initial load itself

Deferrable Views are portion of template wrapped under deferred block 

example



@defer(on trigger)
{

component 
}

Deferrable View = Lazy Loading of Any Component inside a Template


@defer
{
<component>
}



Default trigger will be Idle 
when browser is not doing anything


if you want to display default html when component is not loading then use PlaceHolder

@defer(on idle) {
 <app-body-defferd></app-body-defferd>
} 
@placeholder(minimum 200ms) {
 <p>Loading body content, please wait...</p>
  }  

another trigger we have that is  Immediate

As soon as Initial Bundle downloaded it wil download component .it is not same as Idle


 
Another Trigger is ViewPort:

@defer(on viewport) {
 <app-body-defferd></app-body-defferd>
} 
@placeholder(minimum 200ms) {
 <p>Loading body content, please wait...</p>
  }
