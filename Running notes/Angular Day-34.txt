Eager Loading:

In Angular,eager loading is a default strategy where your all application modules,component,directives and all resource

are loaded upfront when the applcation first start. this means everything user might need available immediately

this type of process is called as Early Loading

key characterlistics of Eager Loading:

Default Behaviour:by default any module imported to main application module is eagerly module

initilization timing:all our Modules are loaded and initilized before Our Application begin.so no futher loading request required

Bundle size:it will result to large initial Bundle size because code downloaded for once 




What is LAzy Loading?


Lazy Loading is also strategy used to optimize loading time of your application
the modules ,component,directive are going to be loaded when they are required
instead of loading all modules and there associated component at once during initial application load 
we can allow our modules, application to load Asynchronoulsly as the user navigate to the application routes 
this will result must faster initial load and improve the performance


why use Lazy loading?

it offer improved Initial loading time. by loading only require components it reduced the burden on application and increase the better experince

Reduce Memory issues: since only required components loaded so there is no memry issue now

better code orgaization easier way we are maintaing and scaling Our Application



In App.route.ts

    {path:"simpletemplateform" ,loadComponent:()=>import('./simpletemplateform/simpletemplateform').then(m=>m.Simpletemplateform)},


use LoadComponent to Implement Lazy Loading





Difference Between Observable and Subject?


In Our rxjs we have Observable who can produce and store the result.we can access the result with the help of Subscribe
untill we call subscribe we are not able to get the data


var observable =of(1,2,3)

observable.subscribe(observer=>console.log(observer))


Subject is also one type of Observable

it can act as producer and Consumer

without subsribe method also it will produce and consume the data

it is a multicast 

next('hi')
