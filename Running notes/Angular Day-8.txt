Interface


it is used to define Object Structure
whatever we define in interface all that property compulsary 
need to implemented 
interface is going to be declared by keyword Interface


interface Person
{
name:string;
age:number;
}


const person={

  name:"xyz";
  age:12
  
}



Classes:

         To Create any class we use keyword that is Class

         class is like a container,skeleton
                    or

         it is a collection of variable and methods


if you use class you will get oops(object oreinted specification) advantage


              class Animal
            {
              name:string='';
              sound:string='';
                 
           constructor(name:string,sound:string)
             {
              this.name=name;
              this.sound=sound; 
             }
             speak():void
                         {
                           console.log(`${this.name} make this sound ${this.sound}`);

                         }


            }

let dog=new Animal('Dog','Bow Bow');
